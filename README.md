Ideas:
-Do helpful common words/sentiment evolve over time?
-What predicts strong reviews:
[] Sentiment in the post
[] Features of the post [length, rarity of words, date posted]
[] Actor/director combos
-Is the reviewer's goodness as good across different genres
-Do the words in reviews help define a director's brand?
